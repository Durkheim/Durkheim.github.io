<h2>DBC Phase 0, Week 9</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Blog Spruce-Up</h3>
<h4>February 22, 2015</h4>


<p>
During week 9 of phase 0, we were tasked with sprucing up our personal blogs to make them look more professional. This was a great opportunity to refresh my understanding of CSS and update my bag of tricks.
</p>

<p>
 While pairing last week, my partner introduced me to overflow: scroll as a means of adding a scrollbar to a div. This really added a touch of "modernism" to my blog, which originally looked like something out of the mid-90s. I also played around with border radius and linear gradients to add more stylistic flourishes.
</p>

<p>
 One of the most challenging aspects of revamping my blog was applying changes to past posts. Significant updates had to be made to the html and the stylesheet. This was a lesson to be more mindful of the future when writing code. The code should be adaptive to change in order to minimize back tracking. As I made updates, I was more careful and thorough when creating divs, classes, and ids.
</p>

<p>
  While my blog has improved, I plan on dedicating next Sunday to adding more updates and improving my personal website. I especially want to experiment with DOM-manipulation.Despite painpoints around updating past blog posts, it was great to see how I've improved in html and CSS.
