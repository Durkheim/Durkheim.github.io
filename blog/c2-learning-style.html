<h1>DBC Phase 0, Week 3</h1>
<h2>Learning to Learn with Learning and Thinking</h2>
<h4>January 12, 2015</h4>
<section>

<p>
  Prior to starting phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp, I took a quiz that assessed my thinking style according to the <a href ="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Mind Styles model</a>. Based on the results, my thinking style is Concrete Sequential, which means I learn best when information is presented sequentially with proof and examples.
</p>

<p>
  In the context of Dev Bootcamp, this thinking style is evident by how I approach each week's material and challenges. I tend to work sequentially, while building on previous material and referencing examples in order to better understand concepts.
</p>

<p>
  While I've benefited from a Concrete Sequential thinking style when learning the material, it doesn't immediately lend itself to solving problems that are more abstract or complex. When I approach writing code, I tend to address each requirement line by line, rather than breaking down a problem into parts and coding for each. As problems become more complex, a non-linear piecemeal approach will help me conceptualize solutions. I think of coding like solving a jigsaw puzzle, and it's hard to imagine someone solving a 500-piece puzzle in order. That is, of course, unless YOU do...which is totally fine.
</p>

<p>
While the quiz deemed that I have a Concrete Sequential thinking style, it's important to note that the Gregorc model does come with a caveat. No one is strictly one style. The model is just referencing your dominant style. Furthermore, if we think about Carol Dweck's theory on <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">growth mindset</a>, it's possible for people to change their thinking style based on how they exercise their minds given tasks. While working through this week's problems, I already feel myself thinking more abstractly about concepts when pseudocoding.
</p>

<p>As I progress through Dev Bootcamp, I hope to expand on my Conrete Sequential thinking and become more abstract when tackling larger problems. It wasn't until writing this post that I considered how this change may already be taking place.
